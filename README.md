### Issue Tracker Application

---

This application simulates the development and testing of a software application.
When the application is opened, a window for every tester/programmer is opened.

---

**A tester can do the following:**
- Report an issue
- Remove closed reports


**A programmer is able to:**
- Solve open issues
- Remove closed reports

---

I've made this application to practice for the third test of the OOP course - Model View Controller and Observer design patterns -.
